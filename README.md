# Memory Game

In this memory game the user must match 8 pairs of cards which are initially
all covered. When a card is clicked, it is flipped, illuminated in blue, and its
corresponding symbol is made visible. When two matching cards have been selected
in this way, they both remain visible and turn aquamarine; the user may then
immediately select again if there are remaining unmatched cards. When two
non-matching cards have been selected, they both flip over again after one
second, obscuring the image and re-coloring as gray. When all cards have been
matched, the game ends and a final screen appears congratulating the player
and listing various statistics about the user's game. There is an additional
"play again" button.

In the main screen, there is a timer, a move counter, a reset button, and a
star rating. Finishing the game with at most 15 moves yields a 3-star rating,
finishing with more than 15 moves but at most 25 yields a 2-star rating, and
finishing with more than 25 moves yields a 1-star rating. Note: the user can
always win with at most 12 moves.
